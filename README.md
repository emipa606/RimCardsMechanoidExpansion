You can disenchant **RimCards** to get **RimCard Dust** using the **Disenchanting RimCard Table.** You can craft RimCards with mechanoid Corpses and other ingredients using the **Crafting Rimcard Table.** You can buy them from a dedicated **RimCards Trader**. All RimCards exist in a **Shiny Version** that cost more to buy from the RimCards Trader.

Once you collected all the cards from the Mechanoid **Expansion**, you can build the **RimCard Trophy** for this extension. If you managed to collect all the shiny versions, you can build the **RimCard Shiny Trophy.**
